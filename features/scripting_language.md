# The Proposal

Create a scripting language for ProjectSandstone (or use LUA).

# Description

Cuberite and PocketMine-MP cannot run Sandstone Plugins, to solve this problem we will introduce a new Scripting language or use LUA as the scripting language. Plugins written in LUA will be able to be loaded in Cuberite and PocketMine-MP (and we will encourage the LUA plugins).

##### Advantages

- PocketMine-MP and Cuberite support.
- Very easy to implement in platforms that aren't compiled to Bytecode.

##### Disadvantages

- Fragmentation (I'm not sure that it is an disadvantage).
- Little performance impact.
